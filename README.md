JASS-MP
=======
JASS-MP is the attemp to create a simple media player for DJing huge libraries by supplying good filtering and sorting functionality. JASS-MP is heavily based on the Jams media player source code,
a media player that is no more under active development and therefore released open source under Apache license <a href="http://github.com/psaravan/JamsMusicPlayer">http://github.com/psaravan/JamsMusicPlayer</a>.

JASS-MP is in an early alpha state and does not very much at the moment.
